# Prestige Classes

Prestige Classes are highly specific classes which combine and mix the features of two base classes. The typical prerequisite for a prestige class is class levels in its prerequisite classes equal to the desired class level of the prestige class, so for example, a fighter 2 wizard 2 could take up to battlemage 2. Since prestige class levels hence typically come every 3rd character level, they are powered as such leveled features. 

Prestige Classes are a big feature of the game, allowing for character concepts which are blends of specific base themes and mechanics. 

Examples are listed below: 
* Battlemage (Fighter, Wizard) 
* Elementalist/Kineticist (Druid, Monk) 
* "MacGuyver" (Artificer, Rogue) 
* Tactician (Fighter, Rogue) 
* Archon/"Gandalf" (Wizard, Cleric) 
* Gunslinger (Rogue, Ranger) 
* "Aragorn" (Ranger, Fighter)
