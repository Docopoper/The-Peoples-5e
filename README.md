If the creature knows roughly where you are:
The creature may make a perception check to locate you as a free action.

Creatures may also make an active perception check as an action to locate hiding creatures should they choose to do so.

If a creature locates you it may call out roughly where you are to other creatures as a free action, thus granting them the free perception check.

If you attack a creature while sneaking you immediately give away your location to all creatures that could potentially see you at the time of the attack.

GM decides if STR or DEX is used or either.

If both of you are experts in the required ability the check is made with super advantage.

At will spells

Design your pact
Your powers are a gift, not a deal. Any obligations are up to RP.
Have some pact breaker archetypes for warlocks who want to RP being rejected and no longer being allowed to level into their patron's tree.

Archetypes are not patrons, they are different styles of warlock, which may be picked to align with the patron selected.

Patrons define a bunch of variables (such as damage types, or extra effects on a certain type of power) when you select them. Beyond that the archetypes are patron agnostic and focus more on the nature of the gifts.
Patrons are styles and come with a boon aimed at RP, not combat.
Patron selection gives more bonuses upon leveling up to make the decision feel permeating. Maybe minor combat effects for omnipresent flavor. Shouldn't have a power gaming feel though.
